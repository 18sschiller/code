"hello, we haven't talked in quite some time. i know i haven't been the best."

~"I'm just being dramatic
In fact,
I'm only at it again
As an addict with a pen
Who's addicted to the wind
As it blows me back and forth
Mindless, spineless, and pretend
Of course I'll be here again
See you tomorrow
But it's the end of today
End of my ways
As a walking denial
My trial was filed as a crazy
Suicidal head case"

~"I can feel it like the world was coming down
All my words we're losing traction at the sound
I hope you listen as my soul becomes unwound
I have a hopelessness
I will never forget"

~"It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you. There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do."

~"But now I'm here
To give you words
As tools that can destroy
My heart"

~"I think you would beat
The moon in a pretty contest"

~"i've got soul but i'm not a soldier"

~"i don't know where you're going but do you got room for one more troubled soul"

~"don't you know that you're all that i think about? you make up a half of the whole."

~"when you're scared and alone, just know that you're already home"

~"your time will come if you wait for it. it's hard, believe me, i've tried"

~"won't you go to someone elses dreams?"

~"Oh, and you
You'll be as Famous as an Ocean
They'll try to Name You but Commotion
Oh, it will Ravage them Whole
Oh, but Me
I'm as Dramatic as the Thunder
My Lightning Scares Her, she rolls over
Oh yeah, she needs to get some Sleep"

~"and it was the way you told me to just shut up and try to enjoy myself"

~"though i cannot see i can hear her smile as she sings"

~"In these coming years
Many things will change
But the way I feel
Will remain the same"

~"You’re the first and last of your kind
I wanna be every lever you pull
And all showers that shower you"

~"Pack.. and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell breaks loose"

~"we've seen it all, bonfires of trust and flash floods of pain"

~"it doesnt even matter don't you worry it'll all work out"

~"i'm so afraid of what you have to say because I'm quiet now in silence gives you space"

~"baby doll, do you believe they'll catch you when you fall?"

~"ill hold your hands, they're just like ice."

~"i've never felt quite like this before"

~"gosh, your lips look delicious"

~"baby, it's cold outside"

~"baby, all I want for Christmas is you"

~"I don't mean to pry but why would you even make the eyes?"

~"i'll take you down the only road I've ever been down."

~"Don't you wanna come with me? Don't you wanna feel my skin
on your skin?"

~"please don't go. I'll eat you whole. I love you so I love you so."

~"why do you build me up, buttercup, baby just to let you down and messed me around. and worst of all you never call baby when you say you will, but I love you still."

~"I need you more than anyone darling, you know that I have from the start. So fill me up, buttercup, don't break my heart."

~"what would my head be like if not for you my shoulders or without your smile?"

~"May we stay lost on our way home?"

~"Wise men say only fools rush in, but I can't help falling in love with you."

~"take my hand, take my whole life too, because I can't help falling in love with you."

~"But for now you told me to hold this jar
And when I looked inside, I saw
It held your heart
For me to walk away with
I began to understand
Why God died"

~"Cigarette daydream
You were only seventeen
Soft speak with a mean streak
Nearly brought me to my knees"

~“in my cold arms, you stay”

~"Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear At this moment, you mean everything
You in that dress, my thoughts I confess
Verge on dirty
Aah, come on Eileen”

~"You can count on me like one two three
I'll be there”

~"If you tossin' and you're turnin' and you just can't fall asleep
I'll sing a song
Beside you”

~"Lately, I've been, lovin losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be”

~"You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin’ special”

~"A gift real special, so take off the top 
Take a look inside -- it's my dick in a box “

~"She makes the sound, the sound the sea makes to calm me down”

~"Because a girl like you is impossible to find
You're impossible to find”

~"Friend, please remove your hands from
Over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave but
Friend, please don't take your life away from me”

~"Don't worry even if things end up a bit too heavy
We'll all float on alright”

~"And I will try to fix you”

~"Maybe I think you're cute and funny,
Maybe I wanna do what bunnies do with you,
If you know what I mean"

~"You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress”

~“hakuna matata, what a wonderful phrase”

~"Living comes natural to many
Love comes natural to few
You take the high road to freedom
I’ll take the low road to you”

~"I'm a thousand miles away
But girl, tonight you look so pretty”

~"Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because we know
That none of them have felt this way”

~"Take a sad song and make it better”

~"This room is far too dark for us to stay around,
Redemption's not that far and darkness is going down.”

~"I will make you queen of everything you see”

~"Well, holy moly me oh my
You’re the apple of my eye
Girl, I've never loved one like you”

~"Home is when I'm alone with you!”

~"Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back”

~"Ce soir c'est le soir et toi avec moi
Et tu viens me voir, très bien ouh la la, I love you all the time”

~"Well I don't care if loneliness kills me
I don't wanna love somebody else”

~"Three words that became hard to say
I and love and you”

~"If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark”

~"I don't ever wanna let you down”

~"'Cause I love
Love you so
Promise I'll never
Let you go
In the still of the night"

~"I see your frown
And it's like looking down the barrel of a gun”

~"Then out of the corner of my eye
I see a spaceship in the sky
And hear a voice inside my head:
Follow me instead”

~"When we collide we come together
If we don't we'll always be apart”

~"Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move”

~"And now I need to know is this real love,
Or is it just madness keeping us afloat?”

~"I will make you believe you are lovely."

~”And the last chance girl in a first dance swirl
Leans her head down on the wooden floor
Won't be dancing anymore”

~"My song is love, is love unknown
And I've got to get that message home”

~"Miss Atomic Bomb
Making out we've got the radio on”

~"An ache in your soul is everybody's goal
To get what they can't have"

~"I know the world's a broken bone
But melt your headaches, call it home”

~"I'll be your best kept secret 
And your biggest mistake.”

~"Oh, Miss Believer, my pretty sleeper
Your twisted mind is like snow on the road
Your shaking shoulders prove that it's colder
Inside your head than the winter of dead
I will tell you I love you
But the muffs on your ears will cater your fears
My nose and feet are running as we start
To travel through snow
Together we go”

~"Oh, Miss Believer, my pretty weeper
Your twisted thoughts are like snow on the rooftops
Please, take my hand, we're in foreign land
As we travel through snow
Together we go”

~"But tonight I'll need you to stay.”

~"You're an angel fallen down, won't you tell us of the clouds
You have fallen from the sky. How high?”

~"I can't do the talk like the talk on the TV
And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything, but I'd do anything for you
I can't do anything 'cept be in love with you”

~"I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh”

~"We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love”

~"Oh, I know this song won't do
Enough to prove my love to you
In my heart you'll always know
There is a place only love can go”

~"You got something I need
In this world full of people there's one killing me
And if we only die once, I wanna die with you.”

~"Hey, hey, wouldn't it be great, great, If we could just lay down and wake up in Slowtown”

~"Give me a shot at the night
Give me a moment, some kind of mysterious”

~"Every time I go to sleep
I wish that you were next to me
Two people that were meant to be
Under the sheets
I'm spooning you, you're spooning me”

~"Me and you, let's get lost in these bed sheets
At the very least press my D against your left cheek
She said Fifty Shades of Grey was the best read
I'm more of a Giving Tree type of guy, Shel Silverstein (He's awesome)”

~"Don't trip girl, you know I got you
Let's take it all off, no costumes
See I'm a man, but every now and then in bed I know when to say: 'Alright, it's my turn to be the small spoon.'"

~"And she's like, 'Can you undo my bra strap?' I try to play it cool, in my head I'm like, 'Aw yeah!' Then she's like 'I'm tired' and I'm like 'Aw, man' I was 'bout to crush the coochie like a tall can."

~"I do not know why I would go
In front of you and hide my soul
'Cause you're the only one who knows it,
Yeah, you're the only one who knows it”

~"Not really sure how to feel about it.
it’s something in the way you move”

~"She's the tear in my heart, Take me higher,
Than I've ever been.”

~"The songs on the radio are ok,
But my taste in music is your face,”

~"You fell asleep in my car, I drove the whole time,
But that's ok, I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine,
I'm driving here I sit, cursing my government,
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement.”

~"My heart is my armor,
She's the tear in my heart, she's a carver,
She's a butcher with a smile, cut me farther,
Than I've ever been.”

~"Oh baby, meet me in Tompkins Square Park
I wanna hold you in the dark
One last time”

~"So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama anyway you feel”

~"I need to know that when I fail you'll still be here,
'Cause if you stick around I'll sing you pretty sounds,
And we'll make money selling your hair.
I don't care what's in your hair,
I just wanna know what's on your mind, I used to say, 'I wanna die before I'm old,' But because of you I might think twice.”

~"There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don't know how”

~"Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me And after all You're my wonderwall”

~"How I wish, how I wish you were here.
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,”

~"Good morning my love
It's been a while since we have talked
And you have grown “

~"They're playing our song
Can you see the lights?
Can you hear the hum, 
of our song?”

~"You and me are floating on a tidal wave…
Together"
